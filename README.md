# 🚀 Space Car Project

The **Space Car** is a conceptual hybrid vehicle designed for both terrestrial roads and extraterrestrial environments (Moon, Mars).  
It combines **road wheels**, **VTOL lift fans**, **deployable morphing wings**, **hydraulic landing gear**, and **anchoring poles** for storm‑hold safety.  
This repository hosts the **3D model viewer**, **schematics**, **bill of materials**, and **mission checklists**.
